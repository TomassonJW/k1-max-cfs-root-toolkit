# GATES

Progression is evidence-based. Passing a gate authorises only the next bounded phase, not every later action.

## G0 — Repository bootstrap

Status: **passed**

Criteria:

- public scope and safety boundary exist;
- raw/private paths are ignored;
- agent rules prohibit remote mutation;
- state, roadmap and decisions are explicit.

## G1 — Ready for read-only acquisition

Status: **not passed**

Required:

- root enabled manually by Thomas;
- exact target host supplied outside Git;
- printer idle;
- visible printer and CFS versions recorded;
- likely board revision recorded but still subject to machine verification;
- recovery image and recovery procedure candidates stored locally, or the absence explicitly acknowledged before connection;
- Codex reads `AGENTS.md` and the acquisition protocol;
- local raw destination is inside an ignored path.

Passing G1 authorises read-only commands and remote-to-local copying only.

## G2 — Stock acquisition complete

Status: **not passed**

Required:

- system and firmware manifest completed;
- configuration entry points and includes inventoried;
- services, processes, mounts and persistence paths inventoried;
- relevant files and logs copied to private local storage;
- checksums recorded;
- command log completed;
- sanitisation performed;
- public artefacts reviewed for secrets and vendor redistribution risk;
- no remote mutation occurred.

Passing G2 authorises analysis of captured evidence, not printer changes.

## G3 — Diagnosis sufficiently grounded

Status: **not passed**

Required:

- startup and CFS call graphs exist;
- all known Z-offset, homing, levelling, mesh and temperature writers are mapped;
- at least two identical-job traces are compared where possible;
- Z repeatability and Z reset are treated as separate hypotheses;
- first intervention is named, narrow and justified;
- success and failure criteria are measurable.

Passing G3 authorises preparation of a patch and rollback plan, not deployment.

## G4 — One mutation ready for deployment

Status: **not passed**

Required for each named change:

- exact files and commands identified;
- pre-change backup and checksums available;
- patch reviewed in Git;
- validation procedure written;
- rollback procedure written and plausible;
- no unrelated changes bundled;
- explicit approval from Thomas for this exact deployment.

Passing G4 authorises only that named mutation.

## G5 — V1 production baseline

Status: **not passed**

Required:

- cold boot followed by three successful consecutive prints on a known plate without manual Z-offset correction;
- requested temperatures respected during validated CFS transitions;
- both CFS units exercised;
- fast and reference startup paths behave as documented;
- configuration survives reboot;
- rollback has been tested or safely simulated;
- repository state matches the deployed state;
- remaining limitations are explicit.
